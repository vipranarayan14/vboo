# //rAmAH//

//prathamA-vibhakti-bahuvachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of agent //(prathamA-vibhakti)// and in
plural //(bahuvachana)//, we add the //subanta-pratyaya// associated
with same //vibhakti// and //vachana//, which is //'jas',// to it.

As we are talking about many //rAma//-s, we have many //'rAma'// words
here --

;;;prakriya
//rAma rAma rAma ... + jas//
;;;

Now, the //sUtra// --

> //sarUpANAmEkashESha Ekavibhaktau| 1/4/22//

says if there are multiple forms of the same word are followed by a
//vibhakti (subanta-pratyaya)// then only one form of those will remain.

So, we will have --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + jas//
;;;

Now, by the //sUtra//-s --

> //chuTU| 1/3/7//
>
> //tasya lOpaH| 1/3/9//

the //'j'// in //'jas'// gets //'lOpa'// i.e. it disappears. So, we get

;;;prakriya
//rAma + as//
;;;

Then, according to the //sUtra// --

> //halantyam| 1/3/3//

which says that the last consonant //(vya~njana)// in the //upadEsha//
(here, the //'jas' pratyaya//) gets the label //(saMj~nA)// //'it'|//
And by the //sUtra// --

> //tasya lOpaH| 1/3/9//

the //it-saMj~naka// i.e. one which is labeled as //'it'// should get
//'lOpa'// i.e. it should disappear.

But the following //sUtra// --

> //na vibhaktau tusmAH| 1/3/4//

opposes the previous //sUtra// saying that, it is not applicable to
//'t, th, d, dh, s, m'// appearing in a //vibhakti// (here,
//subanta-pratyaya)|//

So nothing happens to the //'s'// in //jas|//

Now, by the //sUtra,// “//prathamOH...//” the last letter of the
//prAtipadika// and the first letter of the //pratyaya// ~~undergoes
//savarNa-dIrgha-sandhi//~~ are replaced by the //dIrgha// of the last
letter of the //prAtipadika// --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + as//

= //rAm(a + a)s//

= //rAm(A)s ...............\[pUrva-savarNa-dIrghaH]//

= //rAmAs//

;;;

And now, by the //sUtra//-s --

> //sasajuShO ruH| 8/2/66//
>
> //kharavasAnayOrvisarjanIyaH| 8/3/15//

the //'s'// in //'rAmAs'// is replaced by //visarga// (:). \[See under
[//rAma//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/raama-sabdah/main/#ha-rAmaH) for more
details.]

So, we get --

;;;prakriya
//rAmAH//

;;;

Thus we derive the //pada//, //'rAmAH'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, 'jas'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
