# //rAmAt//

//pa~nchamI-vibhakti-Ekavachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of //apAdAna// //(pa~nchamI-vibhakti)//
and in singular //(Ekavachana)//, we add the //subanta-pratyaya//
associated with same //vibhakti// and //vachana//, which is
//'~Nasi',// to it.

;;;prakriya
//rAma + ~Nasi//
;;;

Now, by the //sUtra// --

> //TA~Nasi~NasaminAtsyAH| 7/1/12//

the //pa~nchamI-Ekavachana-pratyaya, '~Nasi'// is replaced by //'At'//
\[Refer the [//prakriyA// of
//rAmENa//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/raama-sabdah/raama-3-1)].

So, now we have --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + At//
;;;

<!--anEkAlshitsarvasya-->

Now, the last letter of the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'// and the first letter
of //'At'// while undergo //savarNa-dIrgha-sandhi// i.e. both will be
replaced by the letter //'A'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAm (a + A) t//

= //rAm (A) t//

= //rAmAt//
;;;

Now, the //sUtra// --

> //jhalAM jashO.antE| 8/2/39//

says that if the letter at the end of a //pada// is one the letters of
the //pratyAhAra, 'jhal'//, then, it will be replaced by the letters of
the //pratyAhAra, 'char'// having similar pronunciation. Let's try to
understand this.

First of all, let's see what are //'jhal'// and //'jash'|//

- //'jhal'-pratyAhAra// represents all the consonants except //'y, v,
  r, l'// and //'~N, ~n, N, n, m'|//
- //'jash'-pratyAhAra// represents third letter of each //varga// i.e.
  //g, j, D, d, b|//

So, the //sUtra// means that if any one of the these letters,

- first letters of each //varga// i.e. //'k, ch, T, t, p'//
- second letters of each //varga// i.e. //'kh, Ch, Th, th, ph'//
- third letters of each //varga// i.e. //'g, j, D, d, b'//
- fourth letters of each //varga// i.e. //'gh, jh, Dh, dh, bh'//
- the //UShmANa// i.e. //'sh, Sh, s, h'//

come at the end a //pada//, then that letter will be replaced by a
letter out of //'g, j, D, d, b'|//

But, can any letter out of the //'g, j, D, d, b'// be the replacement?
No, only a letter similar in pronunciation to the letter to be replaced
is going to be the replacement. In other words, the letters //'k, kh, g,
gh'// will be replaced by //'g',// the letters //'ch, Ch, j, jh'// will
be replaced by //'j'// and so on.

Here, since //'rAmAt'// is a //pada// and its last letter, //'t'// is
one of the letters of the //pratyAhAra, 'jhal'//, this last letter
is replaced by the letter, //'d'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAmAd//
;;;

Now, the //sUtra// --

> //vA.avasAnE| 8/4/56//

says that in //avasAna,// the letters of the //pratyAhAra, 'jhal'// will
be replaced by the letters of the //pratyAhAra, 'char'//, optionally.

//'char'-pratyAhAra// represents the first letter of each //varga// i.e.
//'k, ch, T, t, p'// and the letters //'sh, Sh, s'|//

Since, in //'rAmAd'// the last letter, //'d'// is a
[//avasAna//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/general/avasana) and is one of the
letters of the //pratyAhAra, 'jhal'//, this last letter is replaced
by the letter, //'t'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAmAt//
;;;

But, this replacement of //'d'// with //'t'// is optional. So, we will
have two alternate forms --

;;;prakriya
//rAmAd//
;;;

Or

;;;prakriya
//rAmAt//
;;;

Thus, we derive the //pada//, //'rAmAt'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, '~Nasi'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
