# //rAmau//

//prathamA-vibhakti-dvivachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of agent //(prathamA-vibhakti)// and in
dual //(dvivachana)//, we add the //subanta-pratyaya// associated with
same //vibhakti// and //vachana//, which is //'au',// to it.

As we are talking about two //rAma//-s, we have two //'rAma'// words
here --

;;;prakriya
//rAma rAma + au//
;;;

Now, the //sUtra// --

> //sarUpANAmEkashESha Ekavibhaktau| 1/4/22//

says if there are multiple forms of the same word are followed by a
//vibhakti (subanta-pratyaya)// then only one form of those will remain.

So, we will have --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + au//
;;;

Here, the //sUtra// --

> //prathamayOH pUrvasarvaNaH| 6/1/102//

says that when one of the //prathamA vibhakti pratyaya//-s or //dvitIyA
vibhakti pratyaya//-s which has a vowel at its start, follow a
//prAtipadika// which has any one of //'a, aa, i, ii, u, uu, RRi, RRI,
LLi'// at its end, then both of these (the last letter of the
//prAtipadika// and the first letter of the //pratyaya//) is replaced by
the //dIrgha// of the last letter of the //prAtipadika|//

;;;prakriya
//rAm + a + au//\
//rAm + A//
;;;

But this //sUtra// --

> //nAdichi| 6/1/104//

says that if the last letter of the //prAtipadika// is //'a'// and the
first letter of the //pratyaya// is one of //'i, ii, u, uu, RRi, RRI,
LLi, E, O, ai, au'//, then the previous //sUtra, 'prathamayOH
pUrvasavarNaH'// does not apply.

Then why are these //sUtra//-s discussed here? Because it has
applicability in some cases.

If so, then what happens here? The last letter of the //prAtipadika//
and the first letter of the //pratyaya// just undergoes
//vRRidhi-sandhi// i.e. both of them are replaced by //'au'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + au//\
= //rAm (a + au)//\
= //rAmau ...................\[vRRiddhi-sandhiH]//
;;;

Thus we derive the //pada//, //'rAmau'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, 'au'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
