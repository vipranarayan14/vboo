# //rAmEShu//

//saptamI-vibhakti-bahuvachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of location //(saptamI-vibhakti)// and
in plural //(bahuvachana)//, we add the //subanta-pratyaya// associated
with same //vibhakti// and //vachana//, which is //'sup',// to it.

;;;prakriya
//rAma + sup//
;;;

Now, by the //sUtra// “//halantyam//” the //'p'// in //'sup'// gets
//lOpa// i.e. it disappears \[See under
[//rAmau//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/raama-sabdah/raama-2-2)] --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + su//
;;;

Now, by the //sUtra,// “//bahuvachanE jhalyEt//” , the last letter
//'a'// in //'rAma'// is replaced by //'E'// \[See under
[//rAmEbhyaH//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/raama-sabdah/raama-4-3)] --

;;;prakriya
//rAm(a) + su//

//rAm(E) + su//

//rAmEsu//
;;;

Now, the //sUtra,//

> //AdEshapratyayayOH| 8/3/59//

says that if the letter //'s'//

1.  is not at the end of a //pada//
2.  and is one of the letters in a //pratyaya// or is itself a
    replacement to some other letter(s)
3.  and comes just after the letters of the //pratyAhAra, 'iN'// i.e.
    <vt>'i, u, RRi, LLi, E, O, ai, au, h, y, v, r, l'</vt> or the
    letters of //ka-varga// i.e. //'k, kh, g, gh, ~N'//

then it (the letter, //'s'//) is replaced by the letter, //'Sh'|//

Here, in //'rAmEsu',// the letter //'s'//

-   is not at the end of the //pada//
-   and is one of the letters in the //pratyaya, 'sup'//
-   and comes after the letter, //'E'// which is one of the letters in
    the //pratyAhAra, 'iN'//

So, the letter //'s'// in //'rAmEsu'// is replaced by the letter
//'Sh'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAmEShu//
;;;

Thus we derive the //pada//, //'rAmEShu'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, 'sup'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
