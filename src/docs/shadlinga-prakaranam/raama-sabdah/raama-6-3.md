# //rAmANAm//

//ShaShThI-vibhakti-bahuvachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of any other relation to the
//kriyApada// //(ShaShTI-vibhakti)// and in plural //(bahuvachana)//, we
add the //subanta-pratyaya// associated with same //vibhakti// and
//vachana//, which is //'Am',// to it.

;;;prakriya
//rAma + Am//
;;;

Now, the //sUtra// --

> //hrasvanadyApO nuT| 7/1/54//

says that if the //a~Nga// of the //subanta-pratyaya, 'Am'//

- has its last letter as a short vowel //(hrasva) i.e. 'a, i, u, RRi,
  LLi'//
- or is given the //saMj~na, 'nadI'//
- or has the //pratyaya, 'TAp', 'chAp',// or //'DAp'//

then, //'nuT'// is //(Agama)// added to the //'Am'|//

Now, should //'nuT'// be **added before or after //'Am'//?**

For this, the //sUtra// --

> //Adyantau Takitau| 1/1/46//

says that

- a //Agama// having the letter //'T'// as //it// is to be placed at
  the **start** at the of the reference
- a //Agama// having the letter //'k'// as //it// is to be placed at
  the **end** at the of the reference

Here,

- //'Am'// is the reference with which the //'nuT'// is asked to be
  placed.
- In //'nuT'//, the letter, //'T'// gets the //'it'-saMj~nA// by the
  //sUtra,// “//halantyam//”

So, //'nuT'// is to placed at the start of the //pratyaya, 'Am'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + nuT Am//
;;;

We saw that the letter, //'T'// in //'nuT'// gets //'it'-saMj~nA|// We
also know that a letter having the //'it'-saMj~nA// disappears. So,
//'T'// in //'nuT'// disappears --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + nu Am//
;;;

Similiarly, the //'u'// in the remaining //'nu'// also gets
//it-saMj~nA// by the //sUtra,// “//upadEshE.ajanu..//” and disappears
\--

;;;prakriya
//rAma + n Am//
;;;

Now, joining the //'n'// with //'Am'// we get --

;;;prakriya
//rAma + nAm//
;;;

Now, the //sUtra// --

> //nAmi| 6/4/3//

says that the last vowel of the //a~Nga// of //nAm// will be replaced
by its //dIrgha|//

<!--
    questions:
    1) How 'nAm' is taken as whole and sutra said 'nAmi'?
    2) Why is 'n' not considered within 'a~Nga' of 'Am'?
  -->

Here, the //a~Nga// of //nAm// is //'rAma'|// And, the last letter of
the //a~Nga, 'rAma'// is //'a'|//

So, the last letter //'a'// in //rAma// is replaced by its //dIrgha//
i.e. //'A'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAm(a) + nAm//

= //rAm(A) + nAm//

= //rAmA + nAm//

= //rAmAnAm//
;;;

Now, since the letter, //'n'// comes after the letter //'r'// within the
same word, it becomes //'N'// \[See
[//Natvam//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/general/natvam)] --

;;;prakriya
//rAmANAm//
;;;

Thus, we derive the //pada//, //'rAmANAm'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, 'Am'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
