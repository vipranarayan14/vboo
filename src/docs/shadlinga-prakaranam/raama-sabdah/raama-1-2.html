  <p>
    <vt>prathamA-vibhakti-dvivachana-vivakShAyAm</vt> i.e. when we want to use the word,
    <vt>rAma</vt> in the sense of agent
    <vt>(prathamA-vibhakti)</vt> and in dual
    <vt>(dvivachana)</vt>, we add the
    <vt>subanta-pratyaya</vt> associated with same
    <vt>vibhakti</vt> and
    <vt>vachana</vt>, which is
    <vt>'au',</vt> to it.
  </p>
  <p>As we are talking about two
    <vt>rAma</vt>-s, we have two
    <vt>'rAma'</vt> words here --
  </p>
  <pra>
    <vt>rAma rAma + au</vt>
  </pra>
  <p>
    Now, the
    <vt>sUtra</vt> --
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <vt>sarUpANAmEkashESha Ekavibhaktau| 1/4/22</vt>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    says if there are multiple forms of the same word are followed by a
    <vt>vibhakti (subanta-pratyaya)</vt> then only one form of those will remain.
  </p>
  <p>So, we will have --</p>
  <pra>
    <vt>rAma + au</vt>
  </pra>
  <p>Here, the
    <vt>sUtra</vt> --
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <vt>prathamayOH pUrvasarvaNaH| 6/1/102</vt>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    says that when one of the
    <vt>prathamA vibhakti pratyaya</vt>-s or
    <vt>dvitIyA vibhakti pratyaya</vt>-s which has a vowel at its start, follow a
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt> which has any one of
    <vt>'a, aa, i, ii, u, uu, RRi, RRI, LLi'</vt> at its end, then both of these (the last letter of the
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt> and the first letter of the
    <vt>pratyaya</vt>) is replaced by the
    <vt>dIrgha</vt> of the last letter of the
    <vt>prAtipadika|</vt>
  </p>
  <pra>
    <vt>rAm + a + au</vt>
    <br>
    <vt>rAm + A</vt>
  </pra>
  <p>
    But this
    <vt>sUtra</vt> --
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <vt>nAdichi| 6/1/104</vt>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    says that if the last letter of the
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt> is
    <vt>'a'</vt> and the first letter of the
    <vt>pratyaya</vt> is one of
    <vt>'i, ii, u, uu, RRi, RRI, LLi, E, O, ai, au'</vt> then the previous
    <vt>sUtra, 'prathamayOH pUrvasavarNaH'</vt> does not apply.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then why is these
    <vt>sUtra</vt>-s discussed here? Because it has applicablity in some cases.
  </p>
  <p>If so, then what happens here? The last letter of the
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt> and the first letter of the
    <vt>pratyaya</vt> just undergoes
    <vt>vRRidhi-sandhi</vt> i.e. both of them are replaced by
    <vt>'au'</vt> --
  </p>
  <pra>
    <vt>rAma + au</vt>
    <br> =
    <vt>rAm (a + au)</vt>
    <br> =
    <vt>rAmau ...................[vRRiddhi-sandhiH]</vt>
  </pra>
  <p>Thus we derive the
    <vt>pada</vt>,
    <vt>'rAmau'</vt> by adding the
    <vt>subanta-pratyaya, 'au'</vt> to the
    <vt>prAtipadika, 'rAma'|</vt>
  </p>
