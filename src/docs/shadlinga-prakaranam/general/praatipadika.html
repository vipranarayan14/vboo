<div>
  <p>
    A
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt> is a crude form of a
    <vt>pada</vt> which has a well-defined meaning on its own. Various forms of the
    <vt>pada</vt> are formed from the
    <vt>prAtipadika|</vt>
  </p>
  <p>
    For example,
    <vt>'bAlaH' </vt> and
    <vt> 'bAlam'</vt> are
    <vt>pada</vt>-s and are formed from their crude form
    <vt>'bAla'|</vt>
  </p>
  <p>
    The
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt>-s themselves cannot be used in a sentence. Only the
    <vt>pada</vt>-s formed from their respective
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt>-s can be used in a sentence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The process of forming
    <vt>pada</vt>-s from a
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt> is called as
    <strong>Declension</strong> in English.

<h2>The Definition of
  <vt>prAtipadika</vt>
</h2>
<div>
  <p>
    For the convenience of understanding, let's consider here that 'word' means collection of vowels and consonants only.
  </p>
  <p>
    <vt>paNini</vt> says:
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <vt>arthavadadhaturapratyayaH prAtipadikam</vt>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    and
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <vt>kRRittaddhitasamAsAshcha</vt>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    A word is considered as
    <strong>
      <vt>prAtipadika</vt>
    </strong>if it:
    <ul>
      <li>is meaningful [
        <vt>arthavat</vt>] and,</li>
      <li>is not a
        <vt>dhAtu</vt> [
        <vt>adhAtuH</vt>] and,</li>
      <li>is not a
        <vt>pratyaya</vt> [
        <vt>apratyayaH</vt>] and,</li>
      <li>does not have a
        <vt>pratyaya</vt> at its end, except the
        <vt>pratyaya</vt>-s in the
        <vt>kRRit</vt> and
        <vt>taddhita</vt> sets, and</li>
      <li>is labeled as
        <vt>samAsa.</vt>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, let's take this list of words and see which words can be taken as
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt>:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <vt>kAkuki</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>pra</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>paTh</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>naT</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>sup</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>lyap</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>bAlau</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>khAdati</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>shrutavat</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>shaiva</vt>
      </li>
      <li>
        <vt>kRRiShNashrita</vt>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <p>
    The first word in the list,
    <vt>'kAkuki'</vt> is just an assemblage of vowels and consonants and it does not have any meaning. Since a
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt> should be
    <vt>arthavat</vt> (have meaning), this word is not a
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt>. The second word,
    <vt>'pra'</vt> is a
    <vt>upasarga</vt> (a set prefixes attached to a verb). As this word too does not have any defined meaning of its own, is
    not a
    <vt>prAtipadika |</vt>
  </p>
  <p>
    The third and fourth words,
    <vt>'paTh'</vt> (to read) and
    <vt>'naT'</vt> (to dance) are
    <vt>dhAtu</vt>-s. Though they have well-defined meanings, the
    <vt>'adhAtuH'</vt> condition of
    <vt>prAtipadika </vt> excludes them from having the label
    <vt>prAtipadika |</vt>
  </p>
  <p>
    The fifth and sixth words,
    <vt>'sup'</vt> and
    <vt>'lyap'</vt> are
    <vt>pratyaya</vt>-s. So, they also cannot be called as
    <vt>prAtipadika |</vt>
  </p>
  <p>
    The seventh and eighth words are,
    <vt>'bAlau'</vt> (to boys) and
    <vt>'khAdati'</vt> (s/he eats). Both of them are
    <vt>arthavat</vt> (have meaning),
    <vt>adhAtuH</vt> (not
    <vt>dhAtu</vt>-s) and
    <vt>apratyayaH</vt> (not
    <vt>pratyaya</vt>-s). So can these be called as
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt>? No. Why? Because, they both have
    <vt>pratyaya</vt>-s at their end and these
    <vt>pratyaya</vt>-s neither belong to the
    <vt>kRRit</vt> set nor to the
    <vt>taddhita</vt> set of
    <vt>pratyaya</vt>-s. The word,
    <vt>'bAlau'</vt> has
    <vt>'au' pratyaya</vt> which is a
    <vt>subanta-pratyaya</vt> and the word,
    <vt>'khAdati'</vt> has
    <vt>'tip' pratyaya</vt> which is a
    <vt>ti~Nanta-pratyaya |</vt>
  </p>
  <p>
    Now almost at last: The ninth and tenth words,
    <vt>shrutavat</vt> and
    <vt>shaiva</vt>
    <strong>are
      <vt>prAtipadika</vt>-s
    </strong> as they are meaningful, and are neither
    <vt>dhAtu</vt>-s nor
    <vt>pratyaya</vt>-s, and they do not have any
    <vt>pratyaya</vt>-s other than
    <vt>kRRit</vt> or
    <vt>taddhita pratyaya</vt>-s.
    <vt>'shrutavat'</vt> is formed from a
    <vt>dhAtu, 'shru'</vt> and a
    <vt>kRRit pratyaya, 'ktavatu'</vt> while
    <vt>'shaiva'</vt> is formed from the combination
    <vt>'shiva'</vt> and a
    <vt>taddhita pratyaya, 'aN' |</vt>
  </p>
  <p>Similarly, The last word,
    <vt>'kRRiShNashrita'</vt> is a
    <vt>samasta-pada</vt> (compound) formed from compounding of
    <vt>'kRRiShNa'</vt> and
    <vt>'shrita' |</vt> Since the word now has the label
    <vt>samAsa</vt>, it gets the label
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt> i.e. it can be called as
    <vt>prAtipadika</vt>.
