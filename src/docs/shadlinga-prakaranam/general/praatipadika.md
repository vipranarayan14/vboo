# //prAtipadika//

A //prAtipadika// is a crude form of a //pada// which has a well-defined
meaning on its own. Various forms of the //pada// are formed from the
//prAtipadika|//

For example, //'bAlaH' // and // 'bAlam'// are //pada//-s and are formed from
their crude form //'bAla'|//

The //prAtipadika//-s themselves cannot be used in a sentence. Only the
//pada//-s formed from their respective //prAtipadika//-s can be used in a
sentence.

The process of forming a //pada// from a //prAtipadika// is called as
**declension** in English.

## The Definition of //prAtipadika//

Here, for the convenience of understanding, let us take '//shabda//' to mean just some sound or
a collection of sounds (such as //svara//-s and //vya~njana//-s).

//paNini// says:

> //arthavadadhaturapratyayaH prAtipadikam//

and

> //kRRittaddhitasamAsAshcha//

A //shabda// is considered as **//prAtipadika//** if it:

- is meaningful (//arthavat//) and,

- is not a //dhAtu// (//adhAtuH//) and,

- is not a //pratyaya// (//apratyayaH//) and,

- does not have a //pratyaya// at its end, except the //pratyaya//-s in the
  //kRRit// and //taddhita// sets, and

- is labelled as //samAsa.//

Now, let's take this list of //shabda//-s and see which them can be considered as
//prAtipadika// --

1. //kAkuki//
2. //pra//
3. //paTh//
4. //naT//
5. //sup//
6. //lyap//
7. //bAlau//
8. //khAdati//
9. //shrutavat//
10. //shaiva//
11. //kRRiShNashrita//

- **//kAkuki// and //pra// are not //prAtipadika//**

  The first //shabda// in the list, //'kAkuki'// is just an assemblage of vowels and
  consonants and it does not have any meaning. Since a //prAtipadika// should be
  //arthavat// (have meaning), this //shabda// is not a //prAtipadika//. The second
  //shabda//, //'pra'// is a //upasarga// (a set prefixes attached to a verb). As this
  //shabda// too does not have any defined meaning of its own, is not a //prAtipadika
  |//

- **//paTh// and //naT// are not //prAtipadika//**

  The third and fourth //shabda//s, //'paTh'// (to read) and //'naT'// (to dance) are
  //dhAtu//-s. Though they have well-defined meanings, the //'adhAtuH'//
  condition of //prAtipadika // excludes them from having the label //prAtipadika
  |//

- **//'sup'// and //'lyap'// are not //prAtipadika//**

  The fifth and sixth //shabda//s, //'sup'// and //'lyap'// are //pratyaya//-s. So,
  they also cannot be called as //prAtipadika |//

- **//'bAlau'// and //'khAdati'// are not //prAtipadika//**

  The seventh and eighth //shabda//-s are, //'bAlau'// (two boys) and //'khAdati'// (s/he
  eats). Both of them are //arthavat// (have meaning), //adhAtuH// (not
  //dhAtu//-s) and //apratyayaH// (not //pratyaya//-s). So can these be called as
  //prAtipadika//? No. Why? Because they both have //pratyaya//-s at their end
  and these //pratyaya//-s neither belong to the //kRRit// set nor to the
  //taddhita// set of //pratyaya//-s. The //shabda//, //'bAlau'// has //'au' pratyaya//
  which is a //subanta-pratyaya// and the //shabda//, //'khAdati'// has //'tip'
  pratyaya// which is a //ti~Nanta-pratyaya |//

- **//shrutavat//, //kRRiShNashrita// and //shaiva// ARE //prAtipadika//**

  The ninth and tenth //shabda//-s, //shrutavat// and //shaiva//
  **are //prAtipadika//-s** as they are meaningful, and are neither //dhAtu//-s
  nor //pratyaya//-s, and they do not have any //pratyaya//-s other than
  //kRRit// or //taddhita pratyaya//-s. //'shrutavat'// is formed from a //dhAtu,
  'shru'// and a //kRRit pratyaya, 'ktavatu'// while //'shaiva'// is formed from
  the combination //'shiva'// and a //taddhita pratyaya, 'aN' |//

  Similarly, The last //shabda//, //'kRRiShNashrita'// is a //samasta-pada// (compound)
  formed from the compounding of //'kRRiShNa'// and //'shrita' |// Since the //shabda// now
  has the label //samAsa//, it gets the label //prAtipadika// i.e. it can be
  called as //prAtipadika//.
