# //prAtipadika//

A //prAtipadika// is a crude form of a //pada// which has a well-defined meaning on its own. Various forms of the //pada// are formed from the //prAtipadika|//

For example, //'bAlaH' // and // 'bAlam'// are //pada//-s and are formed from their crude form //'bAla'|//

The //prAtipadika//-s themselves cannot be used in a sentence. Only the //pada//-s formed from their respective //prAtipadika//-s can be used in a sentence.

The process of forming //pada//-s from a //prAtipadika// is called as **Declension** in English.

## The Definition of //prAtipadika//

For the convenience of understanding, let's consider here that 'word' means collection of vowels and consonants only.

//paNini// says:

> //arthavadadhaturapratyayaH prAtipadikam//

and

> //kRRittaddhitasamAsAshcha//

A word is considered as **//prAtipadika//** if it:

-   is meaningful [ //arthavat//] and,
-   is not a //dhAtu// [ //adhAtuH//] and,
-   is not a //pratyaya// [ //apratyayaH//] and,
-   does not have a //pratyaya// at its end, except the //pratyaya//-s in the //kRRit// and //taddhita// sets, and
-   is labeled as //samAsa.//

Now, let's take this list of words and see which words can be taken as //prAtipadika//:

1.  //kAkuki//
2.  //pra//
3.  //paTh//
4.  //naT//
5.  //sup//
6.  //lyap//
7.  //bAlau//
8.  //khAdati//
9.  //shrutavat//
10. //shaiva//
11. //kRRiShNashrita//

The first word in the list, //'kAkuki'// is just an assemblage of vowels and consonants and it does not have any meaning. Since a //prAtipadika// should be //arthavat// (have meaning), this word is not a //prAtipadika//. The second word, //'pra'// is a //upasarga// (a set prefixes attached to a verb). As this word too does not have any defined meaning of its own, is not a //prAtipadika |//

The third and fourth words, //'paTh'// (to read) and //'naT'// (to dance) are //dhAtu//-s. Though they have well-defined meanings, the //'adhAtuH'// condition of //prAtipadika // excludes them from having the label //prAtipadika |//

The fifth and sixth words, //'sup'// and //'lyap'// are //pratyaya//-s. So, they also cannot be called as //prAtipadika |//

The seventh and eighth words are, //'bAlau'// (to boys) and //'khAdati'// (s/he eats). Both of them are //arthavat// (have meaning), //adhAtuH// (not //dhAtu//-s) and //apratyayaH// (not //pratyaya//-s). So can these be called as //prAtipadika//? No. Why? Because, they both have //pratyaya//-s at their end and these //pratyaya//-s neither belong to the //kRRit// set nor to the //taddhita// set of //pratyaya//-s. The word, //'bAlau'// has //'au' pratyaya// which is a //subanta-pratyaya// and the word, //'khAdati'// has //'tip' pratyaya// which is a //ti~Nanta-pratyaya |//

Now almost at last: The ninth and tenth words, //shrutavat// and //shaiva// **are //prAtipadika//-s** as they are meaningful, and are neither //dhAtu//-s nor //pratyaya//-s, and they do not have any //pratyaya//-s other than //kRRit// or //taddhita pratyaya//-s. //'shrutavat'// is formed from a //dhAtu, 'shru'// and a //kRRit pratyaya, 'ktavatu'// while //'shaiva'// is formed from the combination //'shiva'// and a //taddhita pratyaya, 'aN' |//

Similarly, The last word, //'kRRiShNashrita'// is a //samasta-pada// (compound) formed from compounding of //'kRRiShNa'// and //'shrita' |// Since the word now has the label //samAsa//, it gets the label //prAtipadika// i.e. it can be called as //prAtipadika//.
