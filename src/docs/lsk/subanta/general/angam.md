# //a~Ngam//

![angam-intro](images/angam-intro.png)

//pANini// uses various labels //(saMj~nA//-s) so that he can easily refer to
it later and give instructions related to it.

One such //saMj~nA// is //a~Nga|//

//pANini// defines //'a~Nga'// thus:

> //yasmAt pratyayavidhistadAdi pratyayE.a~Ngam| 1/4/13//

After which //shabda// (word) a //pratyaya// is (instructed to be) placed,
starting from the first letter of that //shabda//, till (but not including) the
first letter of the //pratyaya// is called the //'a~Nga'// of that //pratyaya|//

We will try to understand the //a~Nga-saMj~nA// using some illustrations.

## Illustration #1

The sutra, //‘~NyapprAtipadikat’// says that the //subabta-pratyaya,
'su’// is to be placed after a //prAtipadika|//

So, let's take the //prAtipadika, 'bAla’// and place //'su’// after it:

:::prakriya
//bAla + su//
:::

Now, since the //prAtipadika// is used as the reference to place the
//pratyaya// after it, we start from the first letter of //prAtipadika,
‘bAla’// and go till the first letter of the //pratyaya, 'su’// and mark
that as the //’a~Nga’// of the //pratyaya|//

![Angam Example: bala su animation](images/angam-eg-bala-and-su-anim.gif)

Thus, //'bAla’// is the //a~Nga// of the //pratyaya, 'su’|//

![Angam Example: bala su](images/angam-eg-bala-and-su.png)

## Illustration #2

Let's see another example:

By the sutras, //‘dhAtOH| 3/1/91’, ‘vartamanE laT| 3/2/123’, ‘lasya|
3/4/77’// and //’tip-tas-jhi…| 3/4/78’//, the //ti~Nanta-pratyaya,
'tip’// is to be placed after a //dhAtu|//

So, let's take the //dhAtu, 'bhU’// and place //'tip’// after it:

:::prakriya
//bhU + tip//
:::

Now, since the //dhAtu// is used as the reference to place the //pratyaya//
after it, we start from the first letter of //dhAtu, ‘bhU’// and go till
the first letter of the //pratyaya, 'tip’// and mark that as the
//’a~Nga’// of the //pratyaya|//

![Angam Example: bhu tip animation](images/angam-eg-bhu-and-tip-anim.gif)

Thus, //'bhU’// is the //a~Nga// of the //pratyaya, 'tip’|//

![Angam Example: bhu tip](images/angam-eg-bhu-and-tip.png)

Again, by the //sUtra, ‘kartari shap| 3/1 68’// we place the //pratyaya,
‘shap’// after the //dhAtu//.

:::prakriya
//bhU shap tip//
:::

Now, what is the //a~Nga// of the //pratyaya, ‘tip’//?

As said before, we start from the first letter of the //dhAtu// and go till the
first letter is the //tip-pratyaya// and mark it as the //a~Nga// of the
//pratyaya, 'tip’|//

![Angam Example: bhu shap tip
animation](images/angam-eg-bhu-shap-and-tip-anim.gif)

As we see, the //pratyaya, ‘shap’// also gets included within the //a~Nga//
of the //tip-pratyaya|//

![Angam Example: bhu shap tip](images/angam-eg-bhu-shap-and-tip.png)

## Illustration #3

Continuing with the previous example, let’s add a //upasarga//, say
//‘sam’//, to it:

:::prakriya
//sam bhU shap tip//
:::

Now, what is the //a~Nga// of the //pratyaya, ‘tip’//?

We added the //tip-pratyaya// with reference to //bhU//, right? So, as per
definition, starting from the first letter of //‘bhU’ dhAtu//, till the
first letter of the //pratyaya, 'tip’// is considered the //a~Nga// of the
//tip-pratyaya|//

![Angam Example: sam bhu shap tip
animation](images/angam-eg-sam-bhu-shap-and-tip-anim.gif)

And, we see that the //upasarga, ‘sam’// is not included within the
//a~Nga// of the //pratyaya|//

![Angam Example: sam bhu shap tip](images/angam-eg-sam-bhu-shap-and-tip.png)

## Summary

Thereby, we learn that the //a~Nga// of a //pratyaya// :

- is determined by the word with reference to which the //pratyaya// is
  instructed to be placed.

- will include everything between the reference word and the //pratyaya|//

- will not include the //pratyaya// or anything after it.

- will not include anything before the reference word.
