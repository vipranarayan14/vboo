# //vachanAni//

Just as we have singular and plural in English, we have //vachana//-s in
Samskritam to indicate the number of people or things we are talking about.

> //tAnyEkavachana-dvivachana-bahuvachanAnyEkashaH| 1/4/102//
>
> //supaH| 1/4/103//

Here, //pANini// uses three //saMj~nA//-s (labels) to label the
[//sup-pratyaya//-s](#/lsk/subanta/general/subanta-pratyayah) and
//ti~N-pratyaya//-s:

- //Ekavachana//
- //dvivachana//
- //bahuvachana//

These //saMj~nA//-s determine the sense of number (vachana) the //pratyaya//-s
will be adding to the meaning of a
[//prAtipadika//](#/lsk/subanta/general/praatipadika) or a //dhAtu.//

> //dvyEkayOrdvivachanaikavachanE| 1/4/22//
>
> //bahuShu bahuvachanam| 1/4/21//

So, when we are talking about **only one** person or thing or animal, etc.
(i.e. in singular) we have to use the //pratyaya//-s labelled as //Ekavachana|//

Similarly, when we are talking about **only two** persons or thing or animal,
etc. (i.e. in dual) we have to use the //pratyaya//-s labelled as //dvivachana|//

Finally, when we are talking about **more than two** persons or thing or animal,
etc. (i.e. in plural) we have to use the //pratyaya//-s labelled as
//bahuvachana|//
