# //rAmAya//

//chaturthI-vibhakti-Ekavachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of recipient or purpose
//(chaturthI-vibhakti)// and in singular //(Ekavachana)//, we add the
//subanta-pratyaya// associated with same //vibhakti// and //vachana//,
which is //'~NE',// to it.

:::prakriya
//rAma + ~NE//
:::

Now, the //sUtra,//

> //~NEryaH| 7/1/13//

says that the //pratyaya, '~NE'// is to be replaced by //'ya'// if its
//a~Nga// is //a-kArAnta|//

Here,

1. //'rAma'// is the [//a~Nga//](#/lsk/subanta/general/angam)
   of the //pratyaya, '~NE'|//

2. And the last letter of the //a~Nga, 'rAma'// is //'a'// i.e.
   //'rAma'// is //a-kArAnta|//

So, by the //sUtra// given above, the //pratyaya, '~NE'// is replaced
by //'ya'// --

:::prakriya
//rAma + ya//
:::

Now, will this //'ya'// also be treated like a [//'sup'//](#/lsk/subanta/general/subanta-pratyayah)?

Here, the //sUtra// --

> //sthAnivadAdEshO.analvidhau| 1/1/56//

says that a replacement //(AdEsha)// gets all the properties of what it
replaced //(sthAnI)// \[except properties related to letters].

Here, the //pratyaya, '~NE'// is a //sup|// So, its replacement,
//'ya'// is also to be treated as //sup|//

Now, since the first letter //'y'// of the //pratyaya, 'ya'// is one of
the letters in the //pratyAhAra, 'ya~n' (y, v, r, ...)//, by the
//sUtra//, “//supi cha|//” the last letter of //'rAma'// is replaced by
its //dIrgha// i.e. the letter //'a'// at the end of //'rAma'// is
replaced by //'A'// \[See under
[//rAmAbhyAm//](#/lsk/subanta/raama-sabdah/raama-3-2)] --

:::prakriya
//rAmA + ya//
:::

Finally, we get --

:::prakriya
//rAmAya//
:::

Thus, we derive the //pada//, //'rAmAya'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, '~NE'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
