# //rAmam//

//dvitIyA-vibhakti-Ekavachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use the
word, //rAma// in the sense of object //(dvitIyA-vibhakti)// and in
singular //(Ekavachana)//, we add the //subanta-pratyaya// associated
with same //vibhakti// and //vachana//, which is //'am',// to it.

:::prakriya
//rAma + am//
:::

Now, the //sUtra// --

> //ami pUrvaH| 6/1/107//

says that if the last letter of the //prAtipadika// is one of //'a, i,
u, RRi, LLi' (ak)// and is followed by a vowel //(ach)// being in the
beginning of the //pratyaya, 'am'//, then both the letters i.e. the last
letter of the //prAtipadika// and the first letter of the //pratyaya//,
are **replaced by the last letter of the //prAtipadika|//**

So, here the last letter of the //prAtipadika// which is //'a'// and the
first letter of the //pratyaya// which is //'a'// are replace by the
last letter of the //prAtipadika|//

:::prakriya
//rAm(a + a)m//

both are replaced by the last letter of the //prAtipadika// --

= //rAm(a)m//

= //rAmam//
:::

Thus, we derive the //pada//, //'rAmam'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, 'am'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
