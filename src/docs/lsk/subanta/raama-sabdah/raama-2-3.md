# //rAmAn//

//dvitIyA-vibhakti-bahuvachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of object //(dvitIyA-vibhakti)// and in
plural //(bahuvachana)//, we add the //subanta-pratyaya// associated
with same //vibhakti// and //vachana//, which is //'shas',// to it.

Here we have to recall that though we are talking about many //rAma//-s
only one //rAma// word is taken here, following the //sUtra//,
“//sarUpANAmEkashESha Ekavibhaktau|//”

:::prakriya
//rAma + shas//
:::

Now, the //sUtra// --

> //lashakvataddhitE| 1/3/8//

says that if the letters //'l'// and //'sh'// and the letters of
//ka-varga (k, kh, g, gh, ~N)// are the first letters of a
//pratyaya,// and if this //pratyaya// is not //taddhita-pratyaya// then
those letters //(l, sh, ka-varga)// gets the label //(saMj~nA), 'it'//
i.e. such a letter disappears.

Therefore, the letter //'sh'// in //shas// disappears --

:::prakriya
//rAma + as//
:::

Now, by the //sUtra,// “//prathamOH...//” the last letter of the
//prAtipadika// and the first letter of the //pratyaya// are replaced by
the //dIrgha// of the last letter of the //prAtipadika// \[See under
[//rAmAH//](#/lsk/subanta/raama-sabdah/raama-1-3)] --

:::prakriya
//rAma + as//

= //rAm(a + a)s//

= //rAm(A)s ...............\[pUrva-savarNa-dIrghaH]//

= //rAmAs//
:::

Then, the //sUtra// --

:::prakriya
//tasmAtchChasO naH puMsi| 6/1/103//
:::

says that, in //pulli~Nga//, the letter, //'s'// of the
//shas-pratyaya// coming after a //pUrva-savarNa-dIrgha// is replaced by
the letter, //'n'// --

:::prakriya
//rAmA + n//
:::

Now, by the //sUtra//, “//aT-ku-pu-A~N-num-vyayAyE.api//” \[See
[//Natvam//](#/lsk/subanta/general/natvam)], the letter,
//'n'// has to be replaced by //'N'|// But, the replacement is opposed
by the //sUtra,// “//padAntasya//” and thus, nothing changes.

:::prakriya
//rAmAn//
:::

Thus we derive the //pada//, //'rAmAn'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, 'shas'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
