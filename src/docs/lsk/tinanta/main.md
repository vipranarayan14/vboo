## //lakaara//-s

//lakaaraa//-s are a set of 10 //pratyaya//-s that are attached to a //dhaatu|// These //lakaara//-s give the meaning of a particular tense or mood to the //dhaatu|//.

The 10 //lakaara//-s and the meaning of tense or mood they give to the //dhaatu// are given are below:

|      | //lakaara// | //arthaH//                        | Tense or Mood              |
| :--: | :---------: | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
|  1   |   //laT//   | //vartamana//                     | Present Tense              |
|  2   |   //liT//   | //parOkSabhuuta//                 | Past Tense, Perfect        |
|  3   |   //luT//   | //anadyatanabhaviSyat//           | First Future               |
|  4   |  //lRRit//  | //bhaviSyat//                     | Second Future              |
|  5   |   //lET//   | //dhaurtyE// (//vEdE//)           | Subjunctive Mood           |
|  6   |   //lOT//   | //vidhyAdi//                      | Imperative Mood            |
|  7   |  //laN^//   | //anadyatanabhuuta//              | Past Tense, Imperfect      |
|  8   |  //liN^//   | //vidhiliN^// / //AshIrliN^//     | Potential/Benedictive Mood |
|  9   |  //luN^//   | //bhuutaH//                       | Past Tense, Aorist         |
|  10  | //lRRiN^//  | //kRRiyAtipattiH// (//saMkEtaH//) | Conditional                |

The 5th //lakaara//, //lET// is used only in the //vEda//-s. So, we will not be dealing with that here.

The 8th //lakaara//, //li~N// is of two types -- //vidhili~N// and //AshIrli~N|// The distinction is based on the meaning they give to the //dhaatu//. The //vidhili~N-lakaara// gives the meaning of potential mood (and others) to the //dhaatu// while the //AshIrli~N// gives it the meaning of benediction. The resulting forms of the two //lakaara//-s are also different. So, they are considered as two different //lakaara//-s.

These //pratyaya//-s are collectively called as //lakaara//-s or just //la|//

## //ti~N//

//ti~N// is a set of 18 //pratyaya//-s that come as replacement to the //lakAra//-s to denote the meanings of //puruSha// and [//vachana//](#/lsk/subanta/general/vachanani) for the //dhaatu// it is placed after.

The 18 //ti~N-pratyaya//-s are:

> //tip-tas-jhi-sip-thas-tha-mip-vas-mas-ta-AtAm-jha-thAs-AthAm-dhvam-iD-vahi-mahi~N| 3/4/78//

The name //ti~N// is formed by taking the first //akSara//, "//ti//" of the //tip-pratyaya// and the last //akSara//, "//~N//" of the //mahi~N-pratyaya|// This name is used to denote all the 18 //pratyaya//-s given above.

This type of names formed by using the first letter of the first item and the last letter of the last item of a list are called **//pratyaahaara//-s**. <!--aadiratyEna-->

## //parasmaipada// & //AtmanEpada//

The 18 //ti~N-pratyaya//-s are divided into two groups with 9 //pratyaya//-s in each.

The //suutra//,

> //laH parasmaipadam| 1/4/99//

says that the //aadEsha//-s (replacements) that occur in the place of //la// (//lakaara//) are labelled as //parasmaipada|//

Including the //ti~N-pratyaya//-s, there are totally 22 //aadEsha//-s for //la// according to the following //suutra//-s :

> //laTaH shatRRishAnachAvaprathamAsamAnAdhikaraNE| 3/2/124//
>
> //liTaH kAnajvA| 3/2/106//
>
> //kvasushcha| 3/2/127//

They are the 18 //ti~N-pratyaya//-s, //shatRRi//, //shaanach//, //kaanach// and //kvasu|// Now, the above given //suutra// labels all these //aadEsha//-s as //parasmaipada|//

But the //suutra//,

> //ta~NaavaatmanEpadam| 1/4/100//

says that, of the 22 //aadEsha//-s, 

- the last 9 //pratyaya//-s of the //ti~N-pratyaya//-s (//ta~N//)
- the //shaanach-pratyaya// and
- the //kaanach-pratyaya//

are labelled as //aatmanEpada|//

Now, these //aadEsha//-s (//ta~N//, //shaanach//and //kaanach//) have two labels, //parasmaipadam// as well as //aatmanEpadam|// But according to the //adhikaara-suutra//,

> //AkaDArAt EkA saMj~nA|  1/4/1//

only one label remains. Since, //parasmaipada// is a general label and //aatmanEpada// is a particular label, <!--and the particular label is considered more strong/important--> these //aadEsha//-s are left with only the particular label of "//aatmanEpada//".

So, **//parasmaipada//-s** are: 

- the first 9 //pratyaya//-s of the //ti~N-pratyaya//-s (//tip, tas, jhi, sip, thas, tha, mip, vas// and //mas//), 
- the //shatRRi-pratyaya// and 
- the //kvasu-pratyaya//

and the **//aatmanEpada//-s** are:

- the last 9 //pratyaya//-s of the //ti~N-pratyaya//-s (//ta, AtAm, jha, thAs, AthAm, dhvam, iD, vahi// and //mahi~N//)
- the //shaanach-pratyaya// and
- the //kaanach-pratyaya//

## //parasmaipadin//, //aatmanEpadin// & //ubhayapadin//

//parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s can be placed after only certain //dhaatu//-s. Such a //dhaatu// is known as **//parasmaipadin//** or **//parasmaipadii-dhaatu//**//|//

Similarly, //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s can be placed after only certain //dhaatu//-s. Such a //dhaatu// is known as **//aatmanEpadin//** or **//aatmanEpadii-dhaatu//**//|// 

However, there are some other //dhaatu//-s after which either //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s  or //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s can be placed. Such //dhaatu//-s are known as **//ubhayapadin//-s** or //ubhayapadii-dhaatu//-s.

<!-- add examples-->

Now, how to know if //dhaatu// is a //parasmaipadin//, an //aatmanEpadin// or an //ubhayapadin// ?

//paaNini// lays out the way to find it.

### Checking for //aatmanEpadin//

> //anudaatta~Nita aatmanEpadam| 1/3/12//

The //suutra// says that if a //dhaatu//:

- contains an //anudaatta-svara// and that //anudaatta-svara// has the //it-saMj~naa//
- or it contains the letter, "//~N//" and that letter has the //it-saMj~naa//

then the //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s can be placed after it. In other words, such a //dhaatu// is called as //aatmanEpadii-dhaatu|//

**Note:** //anudaatta-svara// is a vowel pronounced with lower pitch.

### Checking for //parasmaipadin//

> //sheshhaat kartari parasmaipadam| 1/3/78 //

The //suutra// says that //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s can be placed after //dhaatu//-s after which //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s are not (instructed to be) placed after. So, when a //parasmaipada-pratyaya// is placed after such a //dhaatu//, it is called a //parasmaipadii-dhaatu|//

### Checking for //ubhayapadin//

> //svarita~nitaH kartrabhipraayE kriyaaphalE| 1/3/72//

The //suutra// says that if a //dhaatu//:

- contains an //svarita-svara// and that //svarita-svara// has the //it-saMj~naa//
- or it contains the letter, "//~n//" and that letter has the //it-saMj~naa//

then either the //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s or //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s can be placed after it. In other words, such a //dhaatu// is called as //ubhayapadii-dhaatu|//

**Note:** //svarita-svara// is a vowel pronounced with combination of high and low tone.

*Now, in the case of //ubhayapadin//-s, when to use //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s and when to use //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s? Is it the speaker's choice?* 

No. That is what the "//kartrabhipraayE kriyaaphalE//" part of the //suutra// tells about. It says that //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s can be placed after the  a //ubhayapadii-dhaatu// only if the result of the //kriyaa// (action) meant by the //dhaatu//  is intended towards the //kartRRi// (agent) himself. In other words, if a //kartRRi// does a //kriyaa// and the result of the //kriyaa// reaches himself, like a cook cooking for himself, then the //ubayapadii-dhaatu// representing the //kriyaa// gets the //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s after it.

*Then, what if the the result of the //kriyaa// meant by the //dhaatu// is NOT intended towards the //kartRRi// himself?* 

As discussed in the previous section regarding //parasmaipadin//-s, //dhaatu//-s after which //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s are not (instructed to be) placed, //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s are placed.

So, when placing //ti~N-pratyaya//-s after //ubhayapadii-dhaatu//-s, one has to see where the result of the //kriyaa// goes. If it is intended towards the //kartRRi// then //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s are to be used. Otherwise, //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s are to be used.

## //puruSa//

## //vachana//

## //sarvadhaatuka// & //aardhadhaatuka// //pratyaya//-s

- The //ti.n pratyaya-s// and the //shit pratyaya//-s that are mentioned in the //dhaatu-adhikaara// are called //saarvadhaatuka pratyaya//-s.
  - "//ti.n-shit-saarvadhaatukam//"
- All the other //pratyaya//-s mentioned in the //dhaatu-adhikaara// are called //aardhadhaatuka pratyaya//-s.
  - //aardhadhaatuka.m sheshha.h//

## //sarvadhaatuka// & //aardhadhaatuka// //lakaara//-s



## Derivation of //ti~Nanta//-s

Now, //paNini// says:

> //laH karmaNi cha bhAvE chAkarmakebhyaH| 6/4/69 //

**Meaning:** Let the //lakaara//-s be placed after //sakarmaka-dhaatu//-s in //kartari-prayOga// and in //karmaNi-prayOga// and after //akarmaka-dhaatu//-s in //kartari-prayOga// and in //bhaavE-prayOga|//

Since the //ti~N-pratyaya//-s are the ones that actually render the meanings of tense/mood, //puruSha// and //vachana// to a //dhaatu// and thus making it usable in a sentence, the resulting //kriyaapada// are also called as //ti~Nanta|//

## Notes

- //ti~Nanta//-s are mostly derived from //dhAtu//-s. There are 10 //pratyaya//-s which help in deriving //ti~Nanta//-s: 
  1. //laT//
  2. //liT//
  3. //luT//
  4. //lRRiT//
  5. //lET//
  6. //lOT//
  7. //la~N//
  8. //li~N//
  9. //lu~N//
  10. //lRRi~N//

- Some //dhaatu//-s accept only //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s. Meaning , only //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s can be placed after them. Similarly, some //dhaatu//-s take only //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s.

- A //dhaatu// that accepts only //parasmaipada-pratyaya//-s is known as **//parasmaipadin//** whereas a //dhaatu// that accepts only //aatmanEpada-pratyaya//-s is known as **//aatmanEpadin//**//|//
