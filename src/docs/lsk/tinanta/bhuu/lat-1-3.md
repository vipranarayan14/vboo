# //bhavanti//

As we want to use the //bhuu-dhAtu// in present-tense, we add "//laT//" after the //dhAtu//, just as we did in the derivation of [//bhavati//](#/lsk/tinanta/bhuu/lat-1-1)//|//

::: prakriya
//bhuu + laT//
:::

And of //laT//, only the letter //l// remains —

::: prakriya
//bhuu + l//
:::

//prathama-puruSa-bahuvachana-vivakSAyAm// i.e. when we want to express the //dhAtu//, "//bhuu//" in //bahuvachana// (plural) of the //prathama-puruSa// (third person), we substitute the '//l//' with a //ti~Nanta-pratyaya// associated with //prathama-puruSa// and //bahuvachana//, which is '//jhi//' —

:::prakriya
//bhuu + jhi//
:::

Now, by the //suutra//,

> //kartari shap| 3/1/68//

we place //shap-pratyaya// next to the //bhuu-dhaatu// —

:::prakriya
//bhuu + shap + jhi//
:::

Now, the //suutra//,

> //jhO.antaH| 7/1/3//

says that the letter, '//jh//' in a //pratyaya// is replaced by '//ant//'//|//

Here, '//jhi//' is a (//ti~Nanta//) //pratyaya|// So, the letter, '//jh//' in a //jhi// is replaced by '//ant//' —

::: prakriya
//bhuu + shap + anti//
:::

After this, the steps are similar to those of the derivation of [//bhavati//](#/lsk/tinanta/bhuu/lat-1-1) —

:::prakriya
= //bhuu + shap + anti//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhuu + a + anti//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhO + a + anti//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhav + a + anti//
:::

Now, the //suutra//,

> //atO guNE| 6/1/97//

says that, if the letter, '//a//' which is not at the end of a //pada//, is followed by a //guNa// letter (//a//, //E//, //O//), then both are replaced by that //guNa// letter.

Here,

- the letter, '//a//' after '//bhav//' is almost in the middle of the //pada//, '//bhav a anti//'//|// That is, it is not at the end of the //pada|//
- and this letter, '//a//' is followed by another '//a//'//|// And '//a//' is one of the //guNa// letters.

So, by the above given //suutra//, the second '//a//' replaces both the first and the second //akaara//-s —

:::prakriya
//bhav + a nti//
:::

Combining all, we get —

:::prakriya
//bhavanti//
:::

Thus we derive the //kriyaapada//, '//bhavanti//' by adding the //ti~Nanta-pratyaya//, '//jhi//' to the //dhaatu//, '//bhuu//'//|//
