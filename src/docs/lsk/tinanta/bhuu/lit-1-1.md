# //babhuuva//

As we want to use the //bhuu-dhAtu// in Past Perfect Tense, using the //suutra//,

> //parOkSE liT| 3/2/115//

we add the //pratyaya//, "//liT//" after the //dhAtu|//

:::prakriya  
//bhuu + liT//  
:::

By the //suutra//-s,

> //upadEshE ajanunAsika it| 1/3/2//
>
> //halantyam| 1/3/3//

the letters //i// and //T// in the //laT-pratyaya// gets //lOpa// i.e. they disappear. So, we now have:

:::prakriya  
//bhuu + l//  
:::

//prathama-puruSa-Ekavachana-vivakSAyAm// i.e. when we want to express the //dhAtu//, "//bhuu//" in //Ekavachana// (singular) of the //prathama-puruSa// (third person), we substitute the '//l//' with a //ti~Nanta-pratyaya// associated with //prathama-puruSa// and //Ekavachana//, which is '//tip//'.

:::prakriya  
//bhuu + tip//  
:::

But the //suutra//,

> //parasmaipadAnAM NalatususthalathusaNalvamAH| 3/4/82//

says that the nine [//ti~N-pratyaya//-s](#/lsk/tinanta/) is to be substituted by "//Nal, atus, us, thal, athus, a, Nal, va, ma//", respectively.

| //puruSaaH//     | //Ekavachana// | //dvivachana// | //bahuvachana// |
| :--------------- | :------------: | :------------: | :-------------: |
| **//prathama//** |    //Nal//     |    //atus//    |     //us//      |
| **//madhyama//** |    //thal//    |   //Athus//    |      //a//      |
| **//uttama//**   |    //Nal//     |     //va//     |     //ma//      |

So, by the above-mentioned //suutra//, the //prathamapuruSa-Ekavachana-pratyaya//, ’//tip//' is substituted by ’//Nal//'. So, we now have:

:::prakriya  
//bhuu + Nal//  
:::

Now, the letter ’//N//’ and '//l//' in //Nal// gets //lOpa// by the //suutra//-s, '//chuTuu| 1/3/7//' and '//halantyam| 1/3/3//', respectively —

:::prakriya  
//bhuu + a//  
:::

Now, the //suutra//,

> //bhuvO vuglu~NliTOH| 6/4/88//

says that when a //pratyaya// of //lu~N// or //liT// //lakaara//, having its first letter as a vowel, comes after the '//bhuu-dhaatu//', '//vug//' is added to the '//dhaatu//'.

Note: Such additions are called '//aagama//'. We can call '//vug//' as '//vug-aagama//'.

Here,

- //Nal// is a //pratyaya// of //liT-lakaara//
- //Nal// comes after the //bhuu-dhaatu//
- After the //lOpa// of //Na-kaara// and //la-kaara//, only '//a//' remains which is a vowel. Since it is the only letter, it is also the first letter.

So now, the //vug-aagama// is to be added to the //bhuu-dhaatu// and by the //suutra//, '//aadyantau Takitau| 1/1/46//’, we add it after //dhaatu// —

<!--TODO explain aadyantau Takitau (somewhere) -->

:::prakriya  
//bhuu vug + a//  
:::

Now, the letters '//u//' and '//g//' in //vug// gets //lOpa// by the //suutra//-s, '//upadEshE ajanunAsika it| 1/3/2//' and '//halantyam| 1/3/3//', respectively —

:::prakriya  
//bhuu v + a//  
= //bhuuv + a//  
:::

**Note:** Acccording to the //paribhaaSaa//, '//aagamaaH tadguNiibhuutaaH tadgrahaNEna gRRihyantE//’, the letter, '//v//' is also considered as a part of the //bhuu-dhaatu|//

Now, the //suutra//,

> //liTi dhAtOranabhyAsasya| 6/1/8//

says that when (a //aadEsha// of) the //liT-lakaara// follows, the //dhaatu//, containing a single vowel, which had not been previously reduplicated shall be reduplicated.

Here,

- '//a//' is part of //Nal-pratyaya// which is a //aadEsha// (substitute) of the //liT-lakaara//
- the '//bhuu-dhaatu//' contains only one vowel, '//uu//'
- the '//bhuu-dhaatu//' had not been reduplicated previously i.e. there is only one copy of '//bhuuv//'

So, by the above //suutra//, we reduplicated the //dhaatu// i.e. we make a copy of it —

:::prakriya  
//bhuuv bhuuv + a//  
:::

Now, by the //suutra//,

> //puurvO.abhyaasaH| 6/1/4//

the first of the two forms, resulting from reduplication, is called '//abhyaasa//'.

Here, the first '//bhuuv//' is called //abhyaasa|//

Now, the //suutra//,

> //halaadiH sheSaH| 7/4/60//

says that, in //abhyaasa//, only the first //hal// (consonant) remains and the other consonants disappear.

By the above //suutra//, in the //abhyaasa//, '//bhuuv//',

- the first consonant is '//bh//'. It remains.
- the other consonant is '//v//'. It disappears.
- the other letters such as vowels remain intact.

So, we have —

:::prakriya  
//bhuu bhuuv + a//  
:::

Now, the //suutra//,

> //hrasvaH| 7/4/59//

says that (the last letter of) the //abhyaasa// will be replaced by its corresponding //hrasva// letter. <!-- TODO: alontyasya -->

Here, the last letter of the //abhyaasa// is '//uu//' and its corresponding //hrasva// letter is '//u//'. So, we replace the letter, '//uu//' of //bhuu// (//abhyaasa//) with '//u//' —

:::prakriya  
//bhu bhuuv + a//  
:::

Now, the //suutra//,

> //bhavatEraH| 7/4/73//

says that when (a //aadEsha// of) the //liT-lakaara// follows, (the last letter of) the //abhyaasa// of the //bhuu-dhatu// is replaced by the letter, ‘//a//‘.

Here,

- '//a//' is part of //Nal-pratyaya// which is a //aadEsha// (substitute) of the //liT-lakaara//
- the //abhyaasa// of the //bhuu-dhaatu// is ‘//bhu//‘ and its last letter is ‘//u//‘.

So, by the above //suutra//, the letter, ‘//u//‘ in the //bhuu// (//abhyaasa//) is replaced by ‘//a//‘ --

:::prakriya  
//bha bhuuv + a//  
:::

Now, the //suutra//,

> //abhyaasE charcha| 8/4/54//

says that if a letter in //abhyaasa//

- is one of the letters in the //jhash-pratyaahaara// (i.e. //jha, bha, gha, Dha, dha, ja, ba, ga, Da, da//), then it is replaced by a appropriate letter from the //jash-pratyaahaara// (i.e. //ja, ba, ga, Da, da//)
- or is one of the letters in the //khay-pratyaahaara// (i.e. //kha, pha, chha, Tha, tha, cha, Ta, ta, ka, pa//), then it is replaced by a appropriate letter from the //char-pratyaahaara// (i.e. //cha, Ta, ta, ka, pa, Sa, sha, sa//)

In other words, the above //suutra// says that if a letter in //abhyaasa//

- is the first or second letter of a //varga// (such as //ka-varga, cha-varga//, etc.) then it is replaced by the first letter of the same //varga//
- or is the third or fourth letter of a //varga// then it is replaced by the third letter of the same //varga//

Here, in the //abhyaasa//, we have the letter, ‘//bh//‘ which is the fourth letter of the //pa-varga//. So, by the above //suutra//, the letter is replaced by the third letter of the same //varga// which is ‘//b//‘ —

:::prakriya  
//ba bhuuv + a//  
:::

Combining all, we get —

:::prakriya  
//babhuuva//  
:::

Thus we derive the //kriyaapada//, **’//babhuuva//'** by adding the //ti~Nanta-pratyaya//, ‘//tip//' to the //dhaatu//, '//bhuu//‘ in //liT-lakaara|//
