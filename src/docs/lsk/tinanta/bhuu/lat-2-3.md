# //bhavatha//

As we want to use the //bhuu-dhAtu// in present-tense, we add "//laT//" after the //dhAtu//, just as we did in the derivation of [//bhavati//](#/lsk/tinanta/bhuu/lat-1-1)//|//

::: prakriya
//bhuu + laT//
:::

And of //laT//, only the letter //l// remains --

::: prakriya
//bhuu + l//
:::

//madhyama-puruSa-bahuvachana-vivakSAyAm// i.e. when we want to express the //dhAtu//, "//bhuu//" in //bahuvachana// (plural) of the //madhyama-puruSa// (second person), we substitute the '//l//' with a //ti~Nanta-pratyaya// associated with //madhyama-puruSa// and //bahuvachana//, which is '//tha//'--

:::prakriya
//bhuu + tha//
:::

After this, the steps are similar to those of the derivation of [//bhavati//](#/lsk/tinanta/bhuu/lat-1-1) --

:::prakriya
//bhuu + shap + tha//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhuu + a + tha//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhO + a + tha//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhav + a + tha//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhavatha//
:::

Thus we derive the //kriyaapada//, **'//bhavatha//'** by adding the //ti~Nanta-pratyaya//, '//tha//' to the //dhaatu//, '//bhuu//'//|//
