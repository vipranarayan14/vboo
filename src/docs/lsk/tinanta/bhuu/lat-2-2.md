# //bhavathaH//

As we want to use the //bhuu-dhAtu// in present-tense, we add "//laT//" after the //dhAtu//, just as we did in the derivation of [//bhavati//](#/lsk/tinanta/bhuu/lat-1-1)//|//

::: prakriya
//bhuu + laT//
:::

And of //laT//, only the letter //l// remains --

::: prakriya
//bhuu + l//
:::

//madhyama-puruSa-dvivachana-vivakSAyAm// i.e. when we want to express the //dhAtu//, "//bhuu//" in //dvivachana// (dual) of the //madhyama-puruSa// (second person), we substitute the '//l//' with a //ti~Nanta-pratyaya// associated with //madhyama-puruSa// and //dvivachana//, which is '//thas//'.

:::prakriya
//bhuu + thas//
:::

After this, the steps are similar to those of the derivation of [//bhavataH//](#/lsk/tinanta/bhuu/lat-1-2) --

:::prakriya
//bhuu + shap + thas//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhuu + a + thas//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhO + a + thas//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhav + a + thas//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhavathas//
:::

Now, by the //sUtra//, "//sasajuShO ruH//",  the letter, '//s//' at the end of the //pada// is replaced by '//ru//'--

:::prakriya
//bhavatha + ru//
:::

Now, by the //sUtra//-s, "//upadEshE.ajanunAsika it//" and ""//tasya lOpaH//" the //'u'// in //'ru'// gets //'lOpa'// --

:::prakriya
//bhavatha + r//
:::

Finally, by the //sUtra//, "//kharavasAnayOrvisarjanIyaH//" the letter, //'r'// which is an [//avasAna//](#/lsk/subanta/general/avasana), is replaced by //visarga// --

:::prakriya
//bhavathaH//
:::

Thus we derive the //kriyaapada//, **'//bhavathaH//'** by adding the //ti~Nanta-pratyaya//, '//thas//' to the //dhaatu//, '//bhuu//'//|//
