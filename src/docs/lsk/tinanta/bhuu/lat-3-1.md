# //bhavaami//

As we want to use the //bhuu-dhAtu// in present-tense, we add "//laT//" after the //dhAtu//, just as we did in the derivation of [//bhavati//](#/lsk/tinanta/bhuu/lat-1-1)//|//

::: prakriya
//bhuu + laT//
:::

And of //laT//, only the letter //l// remains --

::: prakriya
//bhuu + l//
:::

//uttama-puruSa-Ekavachana-vivakSAyAm// i.e. when we want to express the //dhAtu//, "//bhuu//" in //Ekavachana// (singular) of the //uttama-puruSa// (first person), we substitute the '//l//' with a //ti~Nanta-pratyaya// associated with //uttama-puruSa// and //Ekavachana//, which is '//mip//'--

:::prakriya
//bhuu + mip//
:::

After this, the steps are similar to those of the derivation of [//bhavati//](#/lsk/tinanta/bhuu/lat-1-1) --

:::prakriya
//bhuu + shap + mip//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhuu + a + mi//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhO + a + mi//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhav + a + mi//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhava + mi//
:::

Now, the //suutra//,

> //atO dIrghO ya~ni| 7/3/101//

says that if an //a~Nga//, having its last letter as '//a//', is followed by a //saarvadhaatuka-pratyaya//, having its first letter as one of the letters in //ya~n-pratyaahaara// (i.e. //y, v, r, l, ~n, m, ~N, N, n, jh, bh//), then the last letter of the //a~Nga// is replaced by its corresponding //diirgha|//

Here,

- //mi// is a [//sarvadhaatuka-pratyaya//](#/lsk/tinanta/)
- the first letter of //mi// is '//m//'//|// And, '//m//' is one of the letter in the //ya~n-pratyaahaara// (i.e. //y, v, r, l, ~n, m, ~N, N, n, jh, bh//)
- '//bhava//' is the [//a~Nga//](#/lsk/subanta/general/angam) of //mi//
- the last letter of //bhava// is '//a//'

So, by the above //suutra//, the last letter of //bhava// is replaced by its corresponding //diirgha// letter, that is, the '//a//' at the end of //bhava// is replaced by '//aa//' --

:::prakriya
//bhav(a) + mi//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhavaa + mi//
:::

:::prakriya
= //bhavaami//
:::

Thus we derive the //kriyaapada//, **'//bhavaami//'** by adding the //ti~Nanta-pratyaya//, '//mip//' to the //dhaatu//, '//bhuu//'//|//
