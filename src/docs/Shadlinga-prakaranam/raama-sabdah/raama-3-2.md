# //rAmAbhyAm//

//tRRitIyA-vibhakti-dvivachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of instrument //(tRRitIyA-vibhakti)//
and in dual //(dvivachana)//, we add the //subanta-pratyaya// associated
with same //vibhakti// and //vachana//, which is //'bhyAm',// to it.

;;;prakriya
//rAma + bhyAm//
;;;

Here, this //sUtra// has to be used --

> //supi cha| 7/3/102//

Before using it, let us try to understand the above //sUtra// --

We know that
[//sup-pratyaya//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/general/subanta-pratyayah) are
a set of //pratyaya//-s which are added after a //prAtipadika// to
change it into a //pada|// Now, of these, the //pratyaya//-s having
their first letter as one of //ya~n// i.e. //'y, v, r, l, ~N, ~n,
N, n, m, jh, bh'// are //'bhyAm', 'bhis'// and // 'bhyas'|//

Now, the above given //sUtra// says that the last letter of a
//a-kArAnta// [//a~Nga//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/general/angam) of such
//pratyaya//-s //('bhyAm', 'bhis', 'bhyas')// is replaced by the its
//dIrgha// letter.

In this context, we have the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'// and the
//sup-pratyaya, 'bhyAm'// placed after //'rAma'// Here,

1. //'bhyAm'// is a //subanta-pratyaya|//

2. The first letter of //'bhyAm'// is //'bh'//, and the letter //'bh'//
   is one the letters in the //ya~n-pratyAhAra|//

3. The //a~Nga// of the //'bhyAm'-pratyaya// is //'rAma'|//

4. The last letter of the //a~Nga, 'rAma'// is //'a'|//

So, by the above given //sUtra,// the last letter of the //a~Nga,
'rAma'// which is //'a'// is replaced by its //dIrgha// i.e. //'A'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAmA + bhyAm//
;;;

Finally, we get --

;;;prakriya
//rAmAbhyAm//
;;;

Thus, we derive the //pada//, //'rAmAbhyAm'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, 'bhyAm'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
