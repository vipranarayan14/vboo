## Introduction

We have learnt that a
[//prAtipadika//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/general/praatipadika) itself
cannot be used in a sentence. So, by the //sUtra//-s --

> //~NyApprAtipadikAt| 4/1/1//
>
> //pratyayaH| 3/1/1//
>
> //parashcha| 3/1/2//

we get to add the
[//subanta-pratyaya//-s](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/general/subanta-pratyayah)
to the //prAtipadika// to give it the senses of //vibhakti// and
[//vachana//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/general/vachanani), thereby making
it usable in a sentence.

<!--
  We also learnt that this process of forming usable forms (//pada//-s) from a
  //prAtipadika// is called as **Declension** in English.
-->

Here, we are going to learn, step-by-step, how the various //pada//-s
are formed from a //prAtipadika|//

The declension of the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'// is given below for your
reference.

## //prakriyA//(Derivation)

The process of deriving a form from another form is called //prakriyA|//

Let's see the //prakriyA// for each of the //pada//-s given in the table
below.
