# //rAmau//

//dvitIyA-vibhakti-dvivachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use the
word, //rAma// in the sense of object //(dvitIyA-vibhakti)// and in dual
//(dvivachana)//, we add the //subanta-pratyaya// associated with same
//vibhakti// and //vachana//, which is //'auT',// to it.

Here we have to recall that though we are talking about two //rAma//-s
only one //rAma// word is taken here, following the //sUtra//,
“//sarUpANAmEkashESha Ekavibhaktau|//”

:::prakriya
//rAma + auT//
:::

Here, by the //sUtra// --

> //halantyam| 1/3/3//

the last consonant //(vya~njana)// in the //upadEsha// (here, the
//'auT' pratyaya//) gets the label //(saMj~nA)// //'it'|// And by the
//sUtra// --

> //tasya lOpaH| 1/3/9//

the //it-saMj~naka// i.e. one which is labelled as //'it'// gets
//'lOpa'// i.e. it should disappears. So, we will get --

:::prakriya
//rAma + au//
:::

Now, the rest of the //prakriyA// (derivation) is like that of
[//rAmau//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/raama-sabdah/raama-1-2) in
//prathamA-vibhakti-dvivachana|//
