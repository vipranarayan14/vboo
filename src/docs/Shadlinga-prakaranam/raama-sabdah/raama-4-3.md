# //rAmEbhyaH//

//chaturthI-vibhakti-bahuvachana-vivakShAyAm// i.e. when we want to use
the word, //rAma// in the sense of recipient or purpose
//(chaturthI-vibhakti)// and in singular //(bahuvachana)//, we add the
//subanta-pratyaya// associated with same //vibhakti// and //vachana//,
which is //'bhyas',// to it.

;;;prakriya
//rAma + bhyas//
;;;

Now, the //sUtra,//

> //bahuvachanE jhalyEt| 7/3/103 //

says that the last letter of the
[//a~Nga//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/general/angam) of a
//subanta-pratyaya// is replaced by the letter, //'E'// if

1. the last letter of the //a~Nga// is //'a'//

2. and the first letter of //subanta-pratyaya// is is one the letters
   of the //pratyAhAra, 'jhal'//

3. and the //subanta-pratyaya// represents //bahuvachana|//

Here,

- //rAma// is the //a~Nga// of the //subanta-pratyaya, 'bhyas'//

- and the last letter of the //a~Nga, 'rAma'// is //'a'//

- and the first letter of the //subanta-pratyaya, 'bhyas'// is
  //'bh'// and this, //'bh'// is one of the letters in the
  //pratyAhAra, 'jhal'//

- and the //subanta-pratyaya, 'bhyas'// represents //bahuvachana//

So, the last letter //'a'// in //'rAma'// is replaced by //'E'// --

;;;prakriya
//rAm(a) + bhyas//

= //rAmE + bhyas//

= //rAmEbhyas//
;;;

And now, by the //sUtra//-s, “//sasajuShO ruH//” and
“//kharavasAnayOH...//” the //'s'// in //'rAmEbhyas'// is replaced by
//visarga// (:). \[See under
[//rAmaH//](#/shadlinga-prakaranam/raama-sabdah/raama-1-1) for more
details.] So, we get --

;;;prakriya
//rAmEbhyaH//
;;;

Thus, we derive the //pada//, //'rAmEbhyaH'// by adding the
//subanta-pratyaya, 'bhyas'// to the //prAtipadika, 'rAma'|//
