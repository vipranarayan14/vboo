## //lakaara//-s

//lakaaraa//-s are a set of 10 //pratyaya//-s that are attached to a //dhaatu|// These //lakaara//-s give the meaning of a particular tense or mood to the //dhaatu|//.

The 10 //lakaara//-s and the meaning of tense or mood they give to the //dhaatu// are given are below:

|     | //lakaara// | //arthaH//                        | Tense or Mood              |
| --- | ----------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1   | //laT//     | //vartamanE//                     | Present Tense              |
| 2   | //liT//     | //parOkSabhuuta//                 | Past Tense, Perfect        |
| 3   | //luT//     | //anadyatanabhaviSyat//           | First Future               |
| 4   | //lRRit//   | //bhaviSyat//                     | Second Future              |
| 5   | //lET//     | //dhaurtyE// (//vEdE//)           | Subjunctive Mood           |
| 6   | //lOT//     | //vidhyAdi//                      | Imperative Mood            |
| 7   | //laN^//    | //anadyatanabhuuta//              | Past Tense, Imperfect      |
| 8   | //liN^//    | //vidhiliN^// / //AshIrliN^//     | Potential/Benedictive Mood |
| 9   | //luN^//    | //bhuutaH//                       | Past Tense, Aorist         |
| 10  | //lRRiN^//  | //kRRiyAtipattiH// (//saMkEtaH//) | Conditional                |
|     |             |                                   |                            |

The 5th //lakaara//, //lET// is used only in the //vEda//-s. So, we will not be dealing with that here.

The 8th //lakaara//, //liN^// is of two types -- //vidhiliN^// and //AshIrliN^|// The distinction is based on the meaning they give to the //dhaatu//. The //vidhiliN^-lakaara// gives the //dhaatu// potential, etc. mood while the //AshIrliN^// gives it meaning of benediction. The resulting forms of the two //lakaara//-s are also different. So, they are considered as two different//lakaara//-s.

These //pratyaya//-s are collectively called as //lakaara//-s or just //la|//

Now, //paNini// says:

## //tiN^//

//tiN^// is a set of 18 pratyayas that come as replacement to lakAras for denoting purusha and vachana for the dhatu it is attached to.

## parasmaipadi & atmane

## purusa

## vacana

## sarvadhaka & ArdhadhAtuka

- The //ti.n pratyaya-s// and the //shit pratyaya//-s that are mentioned in the //dhaatu-adhikaara// are called //saarvadhaatuka pratyaya//-s.
  - "//ti.n-shit-saarvadhaatukam//"
- All other //pratyaya//-s mentioned in the //dhaatu-adhikaara// are called //aardhadhaatuka pratyaya//-s.
  - //aardhadhaatuka.m sheshha.h//


<!-- //tiN^anta//-s are mostly derived from //dhAtu//-s. There are 10 //pratyaya//-s which help in deriving //tiN^anta//-s:

1. //laT//
2. //liT//
3. //luT//
4. //lRRiT//
5. //lET//
6. //lOT//
7. //laN^//
8. //liN^//
9. //luN^//
10. //lRRiN^//
